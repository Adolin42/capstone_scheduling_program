## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Manager/Scheduler
- As a manager, I want to create weekly schedules so that all shifts are covered
- As a manager, I want to see employee availability so I can assign appropriate shifts
- As a manager, I want to avoid scheduling conflicts so operations run smoothly
- As a manager, I want to calculate labor costs so I can stay within budget

### 2.2 Employee
- As an employee, I want to view my schedule so I know when to work
- As an employee, I want to set my availability so I'm not scheduled when unavailable
- As an employee, I want to request shift swaps so I can manage personal commitments

### 2.3 Administrator
- As an admin, I want to manage employee information so records are up-to-date
- As an admin, I want to set business rules so scheduling follows company policies
